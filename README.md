# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the Java language.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Things I learned

- There is very specific naming rules you need to follow otherwise variables can't be read.
- Java is object oriented and works with classes.
- along with private there is another way to keep your code safe with final. "final" allows you to pervent variable changes outside of the constructor or declaration.
- There is a new Switch Case in Java that uses "->" instead of break.
