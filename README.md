# Overview

This project is a recipe book application designed to allow users to add, edit, view, and delete recipes. The goal is to deepen my understanding of Java programming concepts and object-oriented principles. I aimed to create a user-friendly console application that demonstrates the use of various Java features such as collections, loops, conditionals, and methods. By building this software, I wanted to enhance my skills in Java and prepare for future projects that may require more complex functionality.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I developed the software using Visual Studio Code as my Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The programming language used is Java, specifically version [insert your version here]. I utilized the Java Collections Framework, particularly ArrayList for managing lists of recipes and ingredients. The application is structured using classes to represent the main components of the recipe book.

# Future Work

- Allow users to scale recipes based on the number of servings.
- Enhance the user interface to include a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Add search functionality to quickly find recipes by name or ingredient.

# Things I learned


The enhanced switch case in Java can simplify code readability with the -> syntax.

- There are specific naming conventions in Java, such as camelCase for variable names and PascalCase for class names.
- Java is an object-oriented language that emphasizes the use of classes and objects for code organization and reusability.
- Using the final keyword can protect variables from being modified outside of their declaration context.
- The enhanced switch case in Java can simplify code readability with the -> syntax.
